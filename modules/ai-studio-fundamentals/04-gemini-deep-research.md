# Challenge: Building your own 'Gemini Deep Research'
Combine Google Search and URL context tools to perform research.

## Concept
A model's knowledge is limited to its training data. To perform research, it needs to access external information. The Google Search tool allows it to discover current sources, while the URL Context tool allows it to perform a deep analysis of specific web pages.

## Task
Your goal is to combine search and URL context. In [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), enable both the tools and ask a question you want to research. See how the answer changes when you disable the tools.

## Outcome
The model provides a synthesized answer based on one or more searches, demonstrating its ability to find information, reason about, make follow up queries, and read the result pages.

## Question
What are the risks of relying on data you find on the internet?
