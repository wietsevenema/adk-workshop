# Challenge: Audio Generation
Generate high-quality, natural-sounding human speech from text.

## Concept
Gemini can generate high-quality, natural-sounding human speech from text. This allows agents to communicate with users through voice, creating more interactive and accessible experiences.

## Task
Your goal is to have Gemini read a piece of text aloud. Go to the new prompt page in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) and look for the "Native Speech Generation" button. Write a sentence or paragraph and ask the model to generate audio from it. Note: As of June 2025, this is a new feature that is not yet part of the main line model.

## Outcome
You will be able to play a high-quality audio file of Gemini speaking the text you provided.

## Question
What languages are supported? Can you mix different languages in one sentence?
