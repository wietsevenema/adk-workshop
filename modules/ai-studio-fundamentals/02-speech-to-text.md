# Challenge: Speech-to-Text
Get a written transcript from a video file.

## Concept
Gemini can understand spoken language from audio and video files. This is useful for transcribing meetings, analyzing customer calls, or making video content searchable.

## Task
Your goal is to get a written transcript from a video. In [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), provide a YouTube Video (through the plus icon) to the model and ask it to transcribe the audio with speaker identification.

## Outcome
The model will return a written transcript of the spoken content from the video.

## Question
How could you use this transcription capability to quickly find specific information within a long video lecture?
