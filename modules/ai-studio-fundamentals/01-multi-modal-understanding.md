# Challenge: Multi-Modal Understanding
Verify Gemini's ability to understand an image and text in a single prompt.

## Concept
Gemini is "multi-modal," meaning it can understand information from different formats like text, images, and audio simultaneously. This is a powerful capability that allows you to build applications that can "see" and interpret the world, not just process text.

## Task
Your goal is to verify Gemini's ability to understand an image. In [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), provide an image to the model and ask it to describe the image, extract text from it, or to identify objects in the image.

## Outcome
The model will return a text-based answer to your question, demonstrating that it understood the contents of the image.

## Question
What are other types of files you can upload to test Gemini's multi-modal capabilities?
