# Challenge: Your First Cloud Deployment
Deploy your agent as a web app on Cloud Run.

## Concept
Make your agent accessible to the world by deploying it as a web app on Cloud Run.

## Task
Use the `adk deploy cloud_run` command to deploy the tool-using agent from the previous challenge.

## Outcome
You will have a public URL that serves the same ADK web UI and the agent you just built.

## Question
Does it make sense to deploy the ADK web UI to a production endpoint? How would you integrate ADK into your application?
