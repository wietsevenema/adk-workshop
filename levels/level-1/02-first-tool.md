# Challenge: Your First Tool
Define a tool and register it with your agent.

## Concept
The core power of an agent lies in its ability to use tools (Python functions) to perform actions and interact with the world. You will define a tool using a standard Python function and register it with your agent.

## Task
Create a simple Python function that accepts a number of sides, `roll_dice(sides: int)`, and add it to the `tools` list of your `Agent`. Test it in the web UI.

## Outcome
The agent will call your Python function and reply with its result. You will see the function call and response in the web UI.

## Question
The description of a tool is very important for getting good results. Can you explain why? What are common failure modes with tool descriptions?
