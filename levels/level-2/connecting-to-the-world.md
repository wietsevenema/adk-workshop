# Challenge: Connecting to the World (External APIs)
Use an OpenAPI specification to interact with an external API.

## Concept
Agents become truly powerful when they can interact with external services. You use an OpenAPI specification to interact with an external API.

## Task
Create a Hacker News agent using the `OpenAPIToolset` to automatically generate tools from an OpenAPI spec. Refer to [the API documentation](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to get started.

## Outcome
An agent that can answer "What are the top 5 stories on Hacker News right now?" through using the API.

## Question
What is the main advantage of an `OpenAPIToolset` instead of writing individual functions for every single API endpoint? What are the disadvantages?
