# Challenge: Saving Files (Artifacts)
Create and save files (artifacts) that persist beyond a single conversation.

## Concept
Agents can create and save files, called artifacts. This is useful for generating reports, logs, or other data that needs to persist beyond a single conversation.

## Task
Modify your "Guess the Number" agent. After the game is won, store a log of all the guesses, and the outcome of the game, to an artifact.

## Outcome
After winning the game, a `game_log.txt` file appears in the "Artifacts" section of the web UI.

## Question
What is the key difference between storing data in session state versus saving it as an artifact? When would you choose one over the other?
