## Level 0: AI Studio Fundamentals (Introductory)

**Goal:** Understand the core capabilities of the Gemini model family, without writing any code. This section builds the foundational knowledge of what an agent can do before you learn to build one yourself. In their essence, every agent is one (or more) prompts with some orchestration glue code around it. 

**Prerequisites:** All you need is a web browser to access [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). Only the final challenge requires a Google Cloud project.
