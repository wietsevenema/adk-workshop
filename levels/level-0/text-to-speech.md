# Challenge: Text-to-Speech
Generate high-quality, natural-sounding human speech from text.

## Concept
Gemini can generate high-quality, natural-sounding human speech from text. This allows agents to communicate with users through voice, creating more interactive and accessible experiences.

## Task
Your goal is to have Gemini read a piece of text aloud. In [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), write a sentence or paragraph and ask the model to generate audio from it.

## Outcome
You will be able to play a high-quality audio file of Gemini speaking the text you provided.

## Question
What languages are supported? Can you mix different languages in one sentence?
